Are you ready for a quick-paced dodging game? Like Doom but without shooting?
**REMEMBER: keep yourself moving and be quick**
- Press up/down/left/right arrow to move the player in any dimension
- Hit by the falling triangles will reset the game to the beginning (so be careful!!)
- (Flair) There will be food periodically appear on the screen at random position with random color:
	- Move toward and try to collect them but
	- (Flair) If the food is hit by falling triangles, it will disappear
- (Flair) Each time the player hits a food, it will evolve into a new player
- If you hit both food and by the triangles at the same time, you will start the game with the player that evolved once
- After evolving 3 times, the game will end
