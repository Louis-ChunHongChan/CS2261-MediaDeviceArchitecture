When game finished, voff-- for 5 seconds then show end screen.


i found a couple issues with the player clipping through platforms and occasionally getting stuck, so make sure that when you’re checking for collisions you’re checking _every pixel_ between where the player is, and where they’re attempting to move to. also, if the player goes off the top of the map they disappear forever.

for m03, make sure the rest of your core gameplay is implemented:
- implement the time limit and the visual indicator for time remaining
- add the “ground” level
- start working on your XL background (i’m going to be covering this during recitation on Tuesday!)

● Modify background tiles, sprite tiles, and/or palette (either) at runtime
○ Using DMA to replace what is currently in memory with a new version
does not meet this requirement, you must make actual modifications at
runtime (meaning it can't all just come from Usenti exports).

● At least two sounds that can play simultaneously, of which at least one must use
digital sound
○ At least one must be looping
○ At least one must not loop
